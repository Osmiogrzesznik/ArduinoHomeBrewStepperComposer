RPI: REMEMBER-Dont have to have everything in one arduino programs
rpi may upload different sketch dynamically;
APP:multiple programs can be stored in localStorage or inApp db

ARDU: if slowing down execution, each keyframe value max and acc when executed needs to be multiplied by slowdown factor
ARDU:  //TODO:
        // if keyframe has target pos, take current pos minus target - distance to go
        // and check if time divided by steps to go is over max_speed

Ardu:    //if acc = 0 and prev direction is same
    // maybe: array of type of keyframe transition- with or without decel
    //then switch to runSpeedToPosition
Ardu: // one command to go back to starting position
// one command to pause mid prg - 
problem - time wont stop and accelStepper may update wrong after pause
//is calculating using micros() so modify class?
// test first without the class modification
// so do command that just flips the isRunning
Ardu: //IF IN REVERSE - SHOULD IT READ CUR POS BUT PREV ACCEL etc.? acc[p] but pos[p-1]
ARDU: right now its just series of target position and not keyframes
    keyframes are in time, and may need TimerEvents (one stepper starts moving while othe is on the move)
ARDU_APP_GENERAL:
    MPU accelerometer: second arduino with accelerometers allowing to steer camera immediately by gestures
